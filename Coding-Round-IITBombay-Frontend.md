- There should be a button to delete the card in the popup.

# Instructions
- Use simple bootstrap components (additional libraries and css can be used but does not have any weightage in the review).

- Host the resulting webpage as a simple website in a github.io page or any other free static host.
- The codebase should be hosted in a public git repo.

# Deliverables

Candidates clearing this round will be intimated via email a couple of weeks after their submissions.

Note: We take plagiarism very seriously and hence please don't directly copy-paste code from somewhere else without linking it to the source or giving the source due credit. We will run the codebase through an internal plagiarism code checker during code evaluation. We know Code LLMs exist and it might get the job done faster, but you do miss out on the fun of pure coding. Its pretty easy to make out the code output from them. It’s your unique approach to problem-solving that we’re most interested in. So, gear up, trust your abilities, and happy coding!

PS: Some of you might think this coding round is trivial and easy. That’s intentional! Our goal is to gauge your understanding of the core fundamentals before we dive deeper in the subsequent stages of the interview. Remember, being a developer isn’t about writing the most intricate code. It’s about creating solutions that are efficient, maintainable, and address real-world problems - even if they seem mundane or basic at times. So please keep this in mind as you move forward.

### Good Luck!
